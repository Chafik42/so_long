## Summary
This project is one of the first graphic project in my 42 cursus, where you basically have to recode a 2D game.

You have to use the > minilibx   library in order to print your work

I decided to use some Dragon Ball GT set of texture.

You are allowed to use other functions for the bonus.

## Usage

> make && ./so_long maps/

Just like a normal game you can quit it by clicking on the X at the corner window, or use ESC.

The key binding to move the player is > WASD

The number of move is displayed in the terminal.

The gemstone is the collectible, you have to collect all of them in order to be able to escape using the cloud, otherwise the cloud is just blocked.

## Example

## Bonus Example

In the bonus, the player's sprite is animed, with a red aura, the count of move is displayed direcly in the game, and there is an ennemy patrol.

The could will travel in all the map, if it hit you before you collected all the collectibles, you die, but if you gathered all of them, you win.
